        In 2019, Vietnam received 18 million international arrivals, up from 2.1 million in the year 2000. 
        The Vietnam National Administration of Tourism is following a long-term plan to diversify the tourism industry,
        which brings foreign exchange into the country.

        Tourist arrivals in Vietnam have continued to rise in recent years. 
        In 2008, Vietnam received 4.218 million international tourists, in 2009 the number was 3.8 million, down 11%. In 2012, 
        Vietnam received 6.84 million tourists. This was a 13% increase from 2011 figure of 6 million international visitors,
        which was itself a rise of 2 million visitors relative to 2010 arrivals. In 2016, Vietnam welcomed 10 million international 
        visitors which represented a 26% increase from the previous year.</p>
